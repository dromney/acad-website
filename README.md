# Introduction

This is the repository for my academic website. Eventually, this README file will provide a place for me to record my process for getting my website up. I am a true amateur in this area, so I mostly based what I did on tutorials found around the Internet.

Currently, I use Netlify for deployment and Google Domains for registering the URL.

# Links

I used at least the following websites to set things up.

- https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-hugo-academic
  - This one is pretty obvious, but the website for wowchemy is a constant point of reference. This includes in dealing with the "failed to resolve output" error that I run into every now and then (requires clearing the cache or manually deleting, along with editing the config.yaml outputs, specifically commenting out the `home:` line)
- Will add to this list later
- Here are some that I used but need to add notes to later
