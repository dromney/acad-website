In this course, we cover the Arab-Palestinian-Israeli conflict with a focus on understanding Arab/Palestinian and Jewish narratives. My main goal in the course (as highlighted below) is to make students articulate these narratives in a respectful manner, regardless of their agreement with them. I do not have a goal of persuading students toward any particular view. Because many of my students are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we also spend some time discussing the presence of the church in historic Palestine and modern-day Israel and Palestine.

Course purpose from syllabus:

- Understand the most important historical incidents and figures related to the Arab-Palestinian-Israeli Conflict.
- Understand and deeply engage with perspectives on all sides of the conflict.
- Explain, in simple language, why the conflict is in its current state.
- Understand what causes tension and conflict between social groups and how those principles apply to this conflict.
- Apply the principles we learn to conflicts in your own life through regular reflection.
- Improve your writing and critical thinking skills in line with the learning outcomes of the political science department.
