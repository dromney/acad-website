This course provides an introduction to statistical analysis for political science majors. The course focuses primarily on the following topics: probability theory, descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, regression analysis, causal inference, and brief introductions to more complex topics (e.g. maximum likelihood and panel data). The course also helps students with learning how to present and summarize quantitative research to a non-technical audience.

I will be teaching this course in the fall semester of 2024; at that point in time, I will update this page with a link to the LMS website.
