I am an Assistant Professor of political science at Brigham Young University. I earned my PhD at Harvard in 2020 and my BA at BYU in 2013.
{style="text-align: justify;"}

I have two areas of research. The first focuses on ethnic politics and intergroup relations; in this area, I am particularly interested in intragroup dynamics and minority politics. The second focuses on belief in and promulgation of conspiracy theories.
{style="text-align: justify;"}

Most of my projects are based in countries in the Middle East/North Africa (MENA) and Southeast Asia regions.
