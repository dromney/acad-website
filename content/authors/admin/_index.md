I am an assistant professor of political science at Brigham Young University. I am also associated with our programs in [Middle East Studies/Arabic](https://kennedy.byu.edu/middle-east-studies-arabic), [International Relations](https://kennedy.byu.edu/international-relations), and [International Development](https://kennedy.byu.edu/international-development), as well as a faculty advisor in the [Global Politics Lab](https://gpl.byu.edu/). I earned my PhD at Harvard in 2020 and my BA at BYU in 2013.
{style="text-align: justify;"}

I have two areas of research. The first focuses on ethnic and religious politics, where I study how citizens respond to ingroup policing and how their behavior is affected by minority/majority dynamics. My second area of research focuses on belief in and state promulgation of political conspiracy theories. My work is primarily based in the Middle East/North Africa (MENA) and Southeast Asia regions and is published in the *American Journal of Political Science*, *The Journal of Politics*, *Perspectives on Politics*, *Comparative Political Studies*, and *International Studies Quarterly*, among others.
{style="text-align: justify;"}

I primarily teach undergraduate courses in comparative politics---an [upper-level writing and seminar course]({{< relref "/courses/poli350" >}}) focused on ethnic conflict, a class on the [comparative politics of the Middle East]({{< relref "/courses/poli357" >}}), and a course on [Israel-Palestine]({{< relref "/courses/poli474" >}}). I also teach our department's [undergraduate statistics course]({{< relref "/courses/poli300" >}}).
