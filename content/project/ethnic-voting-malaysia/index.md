Building on other work looking at minority politics in the Middle East
([here]({{< relref "/publication/doc" >}})) and India ([here]({{< relref "/publication/pub-goods-delhi" >}}) and [here]({{< relref "/publication/acct-div-delhi" >}})), I explore majority and minority political behavior in the context of Malaysia elections. Malaysia is a unique context for studying majority and minority politics: Since independence, the majority ethnic group (Malays) have enjoyed political dominance, but due to Malaysia's British colonial history, the minority groups (and especially the Chinese) have traditionally enjoyed economic dominance. Additionally, the majority Malays are defined not only by their ethnicity but also their religion, creating multiple levels on which their political dominance functions. Lastly, Malaysia a partly free democracy with a prior history of ethnic violence that makes the discussion of ethnicity and religion, especially around election time, a sensitive matter. Thus, the topic of ethnic politics is both salient and important to examine.

In this project, I explore majority and minority politics in two ways. First, I use a survey experiment to manipulate exposure to challenges to the political status quo (Malay dominance). Four manipulations vary whether this challenge comes from a majority or a minority member and whether it highlights ethnic or religious dominance. I then explore the effect of these manipulations on voting behavior. Second, I use a conjoint experiment to explore what majority and minority group members view as appropriate discussions of ethnicity and religion by elites around election time. For instance, do citizens view a minority group politician discussing discrimination their group faces as appropriate or as too sensitive? What about when a majority group member defends the dominant position of Islam as a religion in Malaysian society? The conjoint experiment estimates these effects by varying statements made by elites around election time.

This project is related to a study abroad I helped run. During the summer of 2023, my colleague [Liz McGuire](https://fhssfaculty.byu.edu/directory/liz-mcguire) and I took a group of 21 students on a study abroad to Malaysia. This trip is of personal significance to me because I lived in Singapore and Malaysia during the 2007--2009 period. While living there, I spent much of my time in the more rural areas of East Malaysia, including Kuching and Miri in the state of Sarawak and Tawau in the state of Sabah. However, our study abroad focused on the politics of ethnic Malays in peninsular Malaysia, including trips to the northeastern side of peninsular Malaysia and the states of Kelantan and Terengganu.
