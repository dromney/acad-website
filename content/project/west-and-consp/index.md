Why is negative sentiment toward the United States pervasive in the Arab Middle East? Why do citizens in the MENA region believe US-related (and other) conspiracy theories? What drives the use of conspiracy theories by states in the region?

This set of publications was born out of work originally done using data from Brandsight (formerly Crimson Hexagon) to evaluate the views of Arabic social media toward the United States. The rise of the Islamic state and exposure to US-related conspiracy on social media led to additional projects.
