I will be adding to this blog in the future with more substantial things; for now, I am merely putting in a post to link to a [new page](/personal/running/) I made about my running. I will be updating that page regularly, and maybe writing blog posts if I decide that is something worthwhile.

For me, noting that I posted publicly about my running record is important. It allows me to be accountable, and hopefully it also allows others to see how someone who now considers himself a runner keeps track of it.

For me, when I started out running, I found two sources to be particularly useful. First, although it has issues, I found the [Nike Running Club](https://www.nike.com/nrc-app) app to be really motivating. The coach they have hired to voice most of their marathon training schedule is encouraging for runners who are just getting started and don't have as much experience. After a while, I wanted to have more flexibility in my running schedule, rather than having to have an audio-guided run every time. I eventually found [Hal Higdon's training programs](https://www.halhigdon.com/), which fit the bill.

I'm now pretty passionate about running. For me, I need exercise that is meditative in nature. When I have tried to meditate the way it is normally shown --- in silence, potentially eyes closed, etc. --- I end up falling asleep or losing track of my thoughts. But when I am running, I can meditate. I can consistently refocus my thoughts on the motions of running, on the swinging of my arms, the striking of my feet on the pavement, the pace of my breath. When I lose focus at times, I can return to those elements. It is calming and soothing for me, and I hope it can be for you too.
